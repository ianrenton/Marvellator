Marvellator
===========

"The Marvellator" is a simple PHP script that generates random, bizarre or possibly worrying comic book titles, usually in the style of "The Amazing Spiderman", "Incredible X-Men" etc.  I think the most horrifying prospect it's generated for me is "The Adventures of Tiny Rorschach" -- even more horrifying because [it actually exists](http://gunshowcomic.com/133).  (Thanks Frankie.)

Naturally, this has nothing to do with Marvel Comics in any way (please don't sue me).
